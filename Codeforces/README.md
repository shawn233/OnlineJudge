# Codeforces

This is the collection of codes and notes for Codeforces online judge maintained by shawn233. To visit Codeforces, click [here](https://codeforces.com/).

In this repository I collect my codes and notes for solving problems in Codeforces.

By solving problems I would like to improve my programming skills as well as my ability to practically apply knowledge in algorithms and data structures. Therefore, I will summarize different algorithms by listing every trick I have encountered. Every algorithm I summarize corresponds to a tag used by Codeforces to classify problems, such as dp, math, implementation. Hopefully, my efforts will pay back in a couple of years.

A simple annotation for folders.

- notes: takedowns for some difficult problems.
- problemset: codes for problems.
- summary: algorithm summaries.

I'm glad to receive any of your questions about this repository. I think answering questions can benefit both of us. Contact me by raising issues in Github, or send me a mail to wangxinyu500103@gmail.com . Thank you.
